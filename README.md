# whatsapp_recentcontacts_python
Add these two files in same folder and run the python code after you scan the QR code (to login in whatsapp ) you can see your recent 
contact list in the terminal.
Few points to note that : 
1- You must be using python3 to run the code 
2- Google chrome and chrome driver version must be same 
   I have Google chrome of version Version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit) so i have downloaded chrome driver accordingly.
3- you can dowload the other version of chrome driver from the link -   http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
4- I have build this code to run on google chrome driver .
       If you still face any issues then you can mail me on my id -  dwivedi.1@iitj.ac.in
